## USAGE

Our main concern in creating the application was to make it simple and accesible, thinking primarily in our users. To properly use the app you can follow these simple steps:  

1. Click the "sign up" button to redirect you to the register page.  

2. Input your information, pick your username, password, and hit the register button.  

3. The application's "kind" page will prompt you with a new act of kindness.  

4. Upon completing the act, the application will reward you with points and prompt you with a different act of kindness to complete.

5. Redeem your badges on the "rewards" page.
